# AlgoViz

AlgoViz is a fun, interactive way to see some of the most common computer science algorithms in action. Whether itâ€™s sorting arrays, finding paths through mazes, or visualizing how a simple neural network learns, you can watch everything happen step by step.

- Sorting Algorithms: See how different sorting methods rearrange numbers in real time.

- Pathfinding Algorithms: Explore how algorithms like Dijkstra, A*, BFS, and DFS navigate mazes.

- Machine Learning Visualizations: Play with small neural networks and watch decision boundaries evolve as the model learns.
